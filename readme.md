### Scripts to process data from the Copenhagen Moat project.
 
The data are from different sequencing runs using paired and unpaired illumina libraries.  
A number of control libraries (sample blanks, library blanks, etc.) were sequenced. Reads  
from these libraries are used to decontaminate sample data in conjunction with the standard  
decontamination files.

The data are being processed using the bbtools suite.
